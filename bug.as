The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of an object that might be null or undefined, leading to a runtime error: 

```actionscript
var myObject:Object = getMyObject();
trace(myObject.someProperty); 
```

This code will throw a runtime error if `getMyObject()` returns `null` or `undefined` because you can't access `someProperty` of a null object.  The error message will be something like `TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.`
